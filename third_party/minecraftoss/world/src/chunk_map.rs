//! Player-driven chunk loading, generation and sending.
//!
//! Vanilla 26.3 behavior kept here:
//! - A player tracks `ChunkTrackingView.of(chunkPosition, viewDistance)`,
//!   with the view distance clamped to `2..=32` (`ChunkMap.getPlayerViewDistance`);
//!   this client's render distance option goes on to 64.
//! - Loading work starts nearest first by chessboard distance, the level
//!   `FixedPlayerDistanceChunkTracker` assigns to player tickets before the
//!   `ThrottlingChunkTaskDispatcher` releases them.
//! - A chunk is FULL once it and its eight neighbours have run FEATURES:
//!   vanilla's LIGHT step needs INITIALIZE_LIGHT, and so FEATURES, one ring
//!   out, so no later decoration writes into it. FEATURES itself needs its
//!   3x3 at TERRAIN and writes into all nine chunks.
//! - A chunk is sent once it is block ticking, its whole 3x3 FULL
//!   (`ChunkMap.prepareTickingChunk`), right after
//!   `LevelChunk.postProcessGeneration` re-shapes its marked positions.
//! - A chunk becomes pending for the player when it is ready and tracked
//!   (`onChunkReadyToSend`, `applyChunkTrackingView`). Leaving the view drops a
//!   pending chunk silently or tells the client to forget a sent one
//!   (`PlayerChunkSender.dropChunk`).
//! - Every tick a memory connection receives all pending chunks, sorted by
//!   squared distance to the player's chunk (`PlayerChunkSender.collectChunksToSend`).
//!
//! Vanilla generates a handful of ticketed chunks at a time. Here every idle
//! worker takes the best available job, TERRAIN or FEATURES, so the same
//! order completes far sooner. Decorations whose 3x3 regions overlap never
//! run at once: a FEATURES job checks out all nine chunks.
